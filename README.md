# Library App
By Héctor González Orozco

Simple app made with Express.
It allows the user to perform CRUD operations on elements relevant to library archives: Authors, genres, books and book instances.

Made following the [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs).
